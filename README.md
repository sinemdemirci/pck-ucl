**Abstract**:

Data science, which has an interdisciplinary nature, is a relatively new discipline that requires mastering many skills and concepts associated with statistics, computer science and mathematics. In this context, the issue of how to teach subjects and concepts in data science is still being evolved. On the other hand, the number of individuals employed in many occupational areas related to data science is increasing rapidly. Various studies are carried out in higher education to meet the increasing demand and to contribute to the literature; thus, more research on data science education is needed. To that end, the purpose of this talk is to introduce initial outcomes of our study, Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) of the introductory data science instructors. PCK is one of the theoretical frameworks that provide an insight to an integration of content and pedagogy to teaching that enable instructors to monitor their teaching practices (Shulman, 1987). As the Introduction to Data Science course provides a baseline for understanding the nature of data science and promote capacity building, determining PCK of the instructors could provide an insight for the needs in data science education. Although the teaching materials and best practices based on the standards provide some clues on the needs, when viewed from the PCK framework, it is necessary to emphasize the PCK components of data science educators in a holistic way.
